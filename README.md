This document is a guide to get started with High Performance Computer clusters (HPCC) and more particularly [Uninett Sigma2's HPCC](https://www.sigma2.no/high-performance-computing). This guide aims at understanding the basic commands for navigating in the terminal of an HPCC, at helping running a **job script** and at managing files such as copying files from your local directory to the HPCC and using files that are stored remotely.
