# What is HPC and why using it?

**High performance computing** (HPC) generally refers to processing complex calculations at high speeds across multiple servers in parallel. Those groups of servers are known as clusters and are composed of **hundreds or even thousands of compute servers** that have been connected through a network. 

With the increased use of technologies like the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML), organizations are producing huge quantities of data, and they need to be able to process and use that data more quickly in real-time. To power the analysis of such large dataset it is often more practical / mandatory to make use of supercomputing. Supercomputing enables fast processing of data and training of complex algorithms such as neural networks for image and sound recognition.
